<p>
	I'm a young and vibrant lady born and raised in Lansing, MI and moved to Texas in 2011. Keeping my eye on the prize and motivating myself daily is my main focus. Surfing the web "learning" and reading takes up most of my time. I love traveling, Teaching, Technology, Photography and Fitness. Overcoming challenges and exploring new things including jobs, adds to my growth. Throughout my career I have gained multiple skills such as customer service skills, troubleshooting/computer skills, communication skills, the ability to be resiliant and more.
